CE1007 - Customer Escalation Summary
=====================================

Customer: Reliance
Priority: Medium
Status: Resolved
Created: 2024-01-27
Escalated: 2024-01-28
Resolved: 2024-01-30

Issue Description:
-----------------
Customer Reliance reported performance degradation on their YugabyteDB nodes.
The database was experiencing high CPU usage and memory pressure, leading to
slow query response times and connection timeouts.

Root Cause Analysis:
-------------------
1. OS/THP (Transparent Huge Pages) Issue:
   - THP enabled causing memory fragmentation
   - High CPU usage due to memory compaction
   - Kernel parameter misconfiguration
   - NUMA node allocation issues

2. System Configuration:
   - THP set to "always" instead of "madvise"
   - Insufficient swap space configured
   - Memory allocation causing page faults
   - CPU scheduling issues with high load

3. Impact on Database:
   - Memory allocation delays
   - Increased query response times
   - Connection pool exhaustion
   - Backup operations timing out

Technical Details:
-----------------
- OS: RHEL 8.4 with kernel 4.18.0-305
- THP Setting: always (should be madvise)
- Memory: 256GB with 8GB swap
- CPU: 32 cores with high utilization
- NUMA: 4 nodes with uneven allocation

Impact Assessment:
-----------------
- Business Impact: Medium - Performance degradation affecting operations
- Affected Users: ~5,000 concurrent users
- Performance Impact: 200% increase in query response times
- Operational Risk: Backup failures and timeouts

Action Plan:
------------
1. Immediate (0-4 hours):
   - Disable THP and restart database nodes
   - Optimize kernel parameters
   - Add memory monitoring

2. Short-term (4-24 hours):
   - Configure proper swap space
   - Optimize NUMA node allocation
   - Implement memory monitoring

3. Long-term (1-7 days):
   - Document OS optimization best practices
   - Implement automated health checks
   - Add performance monitoring

Resolution Summary:
------------------
- THP disabled and kernel parameters optimized
- Memory allocation improved
- Performance returned to normal levels
- Monitoring implemented for early detection

Current Status:
---------------
- Issue fully resolved
- Performance restored to normal
- Monitoring in place
- Customer satisfied with resolution

Customer Sentiment:
------------------
- Customer was concerned about performance issues
- Appreciated the quick identification of OS-level issue
- Satisfied with the comprehensive solution
- Overall sentiment: Satisfied and confident in stability

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Monitor performance for 1 week
2. Share OS optimization best practices
3. Schedule follow-up review
4. Close CE after verification period
