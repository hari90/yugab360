CE1000 - Customer Escalation Summary
=====================================

Customer: Aegis
Priority: High
Status: In Progress
Created: 2024-01-15
Escalated: 2024-01-16

Issue Description:
-----------------
Customer Aegis is experiencing severe performance degradation with their YugabyteDB cluster. 
Multiple queries are timing out and response times have increased by 300-500% over the past 48 hours.
The issue appears to be related to a hot shard problem affecting their primary transaction table.

Root Cause Analysis:
-------------------
1. Hot Shard Issue: Table 'transactions' has uneven data distribution
   - 80% of data concentrated in shard 3
   - Other shards (1, 2, 4, 5) underutilized
   - Causing network bottlenecks and increased latency

2. Query Performance Impact:
   - SELECT queries on transactions table taking 15-30 seconds (normally <1s)
   - INSERT operations experiencing 5-10 second delays
   - Connection pool exhaustion due to long-running queries

3. Cluster Configuration:
   - 5-node cluster across 3 availability zones
   - RF=3 replication factor
   - 16 vCPUs, 64GB RAM per node

Technical Details:
-----------------
- Affected Table: transactions
- Hot Shard: shard_3 (UUID: 8f7a2b1c-3d4e-5f6g-7h8i-9j0k1l2m3n4o)
- Data Distribution: 80% in shard_3, 20% across other shards
- Query Pattern: Range scans on timestamp column
- Index Issues: Missing composite index on (customer_id, timestamp)

Impact Assessment:
-----------------
- Business Impact: High - Customer facing 15-30 second delays
- Affected Users: ~10,000 concurrent users
- Revenue Impact: Estimated $50K daily revenue at risk
- SLA Violation: 99.9% uptime SLA at risk

Action Plan:
------------
1. Immediate (0-4 hours):
   - Implement query optimization with proper indexes
   - Add connection pool tuning
   - Enable query monitoring and alerting

2. Short-term (4-24 hours):
   - Redistribute data across shards using tablet splitting
   - Implement read replicas for hot data
   - Optimize table partitioning strategy

3. Long-term (1-7 days):
   - Implement proper sharding strategy
   - Add monitoring and alerting for hot shards
   - Document best practices for data distribution

Current Status:
---------------
- CE assigned to Senior Support Engineer
- Customer provided cluster access and logs
- Initial analysis completed
- Action plan approved by customer
- Implementation in progress

Customer Sentiment:
------------------
- Customer is frustrated with the performance degradation
- Technical team is cooperative but under pressure from business stakeholders
- Customer appreciates the quick escalation and detailed analysis
- Concerns about meeting SLA requirements and potential revenue impact
- Customer has requested daily status updates and regular communication
- Overall sentiment: Anxious but hopeful with proper support engagement

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Execute immediate query optimizations
2. Monitor performance improvements
3. Schedule follow-up call with customer
4. Document lessons learned for future reference
